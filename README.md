# Robust Node.js

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to provide a refernece point on how one might design and implement all aspects of a robust, production-grade Node.js applications.
Although the solutions presented below were subjected to careful research, and are battle tested, by no means they are the be-all-and-end-all solution. Applications requirments will very by the use case they intednded to serve.

## Core Prinicipals Guiding This Project

 - [**SOLID**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)  - as a way of life
 - **Testing** - so you can sleep well
 - **Monitoring** - we all break things, the question is can you catch production failures before a client notices?



## Architecture
[Layerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture) Archtecture
[Hexagonal](https://blog.octo.com/en/hexagonal-architecture-three-principles-and-an-implementation-example/) Architecture 
[Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) Driven Design - to serve tow functions: 
 A. **Feature (domain) Scope Bounding** - know where a feature start and ends
 B. **Developer Business Proficency** - Know everything about one thing.
